# Safety-Helmet-Detection 🦺 

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a **real-time helmet detection system** built with **Python, OpenCV, and YOLOv5** to enhance workplace safety. It helps prevent accidents by detecting whether a person is wearing a helmet and generating alerts for non-compliance.  

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ **Real-time helmet detection** using deep learning  
✔️ **Computer vision-based approach** for accuracy  
✔️ **Alerts for non-compliance** to improve safety  
✔️ **Scalable and adaptable** for industrial environments  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **OpenCV** 👁️‍🗨️  
- **YOLOv5** 🔍  

## 🎯 How It Works  
1️⃣ The system captures video frames.  
2️⃣ YOLOv5 detects people and helmets.  
3️⃣ If a person is **not wearing** a helmet, the system triggers an **alert**.
